# PasswordGenerator
Implementing a password generating website with vanilla Javascript.

## Small Disclaimer
Just because a character option is selected does not necessarily mean it will appear in the password, as all are generated randomly. Guarenteeing minimum character inclusion could be a desired feature, but it is not currently implemented as such. If one felt so inclined they couuld create a function that checks, and forces the program to generate new passwords until all conditions had been included at least once...however I think this is a technically unnecessary addition at the moment.

The project can be found here [on my github.io](https://reidmadock.github.io/PasswordGenerator/)

## Screenshots
This is what the site looks like with a 99 character screenshot generated.
